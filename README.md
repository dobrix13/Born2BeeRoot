### 1: Install virtual box:
    Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/ and folow instructions.
### 2: Create new Virtual_Maschine and install OS of your choice
I have choosen Centos / RHEL. The reason for that is diffficult to explain. In my oppinion if you use minimal install without GUI tere's no big difference between distributiions.

### LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
Logical volume manager (LVM) introduces an extra layer between the physical disks and the file system allowing file systems to be :

> resized and moved easily and online without requiring a system-wide outage.
> 
> Using discontinuous space on disk.
> 
> meaningful names to volumes, rather than the usual cryptic device names.
> 
> span multiple physical disks.

### 4: install minimum server without GUI
### 5: configure ssh
Start by opening the /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file with nano or your preferred text editor.
search for line

    #Port 22
    #AddressFamily any
    #ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
    #ListenAddress ::

 Uncoment line port and cange 22 to <your_port_#>
 ### 6: Deny ssh root acces
 
    Permitrootlogin=no
### 7: configure selinux policy for ssh

    semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp <your_custom_port #>
### 8: configure firewall
UFW isnâ€™t available on the CentOS repository. We need to install the EPEL repository on our server.

    sudo dnf install epel-release -y

Now install and enable UFW:

#### install
    sudo dnf install ufw -y

#### enable
    sudo ufw enable

Check the status of UFW:

    sudo ufw status

To alow port <your_port_#>
    
    ufw allow <your_port_#>

### 9: customize password policy
a ery straight forward way to setup pasword policy is to edit /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with CL text editor. sudo permissions are needed
    
    /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    /etc/pam.d
    /etc/login.defs //password expiration dates
### 10: Banner: (just for fun!!!)
edit files in /etc/skel/ directory

### 11: Configuring sudo

Configure sudo via sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/<filename>. <filename> shall not end in ~ or contain ..

$ sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/<filename>

To limit authentication using sudo to 3 attempts (defaults to 3 anyway) in the event of an incorrect password, add below line to the file.

Defaults        passwd_tries=3

To add a custom error message in the event of an incorrect password:

Defaults        badpass_message="<custom-error-message>"

To log all sudo commands to /var/log/sudo/<filename>:

$ sudo mkdir /var/log/sudo
<~~~>
Defaults        logfile="/var/log/sudo/<filename>"
<~~~>

To archive all sudo inputs & outputs to /var/log/sudo/:

Defaults        log_input,log_output
Defaults        iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo"

To require TTY:

Defaults        requiretty

To set sudo paths to /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin:

Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
